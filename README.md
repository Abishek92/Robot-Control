# Robot-Control
Equations of Motion Function (EOM) to simulate the Equations of Motion of a Planar Elbow Manipulator
It contains the equations that simulate the dynamics of a two-link robot.

The Main code calls this function and with the given initial conditions, simulates the robot mainpulator using 'ode45' solver.
